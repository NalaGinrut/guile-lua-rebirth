Guile-Lua (rebirth)
=========

Guile-Lua is a Lua frontend on Guile platform. Guile is the GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language
for Extensions, and the official extension language of the GNU project.
Guile could be used for implementing compiler front-ends to support many languages like Lua, which means your application may be
extended in the language (or languages) most appropriate for your user base. 

Guile-Lua aims to be compatible with Lua-5.2, and intractive with other Guile programes writtern in
other languages on Guile. The first target is to work with GNU Artanis, actually, it works now.

Guile-Lua is still working in progress, but almost done and works fine.
