*Because Microsoft has aquired GitHub, as a congrats, I would like to migrate this project to GitLab and this repo will not be maintained on GitHub anymore:*

Guile-Lua is a Lua frontend on Guile platform. Guile is the GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language
for Extensions, and the official extension language of the GNU project.
Guile includes compiler front-ends for multi-langs like Lua, which means your application may be
extended in the language (or languages) most appropriate for your user base. 

Guile-Lua aims to be compatible with Lua-5.2, and intractive with other Guile programes writtern in
other languages on Guile. The first target is to work with GNU Artanis, actually, it works now.

Guile-Lua is still working in progress, but almost done and works fine.
